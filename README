Next for SIFT
  SIFT feature extraction + bag of words and SVM? 
  might want to use ORB for speed/efficiency instead 
  
 data_gen_try_3 works as is, try adding more noise and see if knnMatch still works
 
 CNN approach, make a full set of data and see if it trains well
 
 SIFT-CNN
 
 Try CyCNN or Spatial Transformer Network
